Testing is without a doubt one of the most important things that we can do to ensure our app behaves the way that is intended. When it comes to React, we have many options, what I used to do before the super popular React Testing Library is using Enzyme. This blog post will focus mainly on React Testing Library.

The two ways to go about testing the app

> Rendering component trees in a simplified test environment and asserting on their output.

> Running a complete app in a realistic browser environment (also known as “end-to-end” tests).

## Simple Test with ReactDOM

## Simple Test with React Testing Library

## Avoid Implementation details

## Form testing

## Mock HTTP response

## Mock browser api and modules

## Context and custom render method

## Testing custom hooks
