So what is React Portal? Is there something special about it?

From the official definition from the React website:

> Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

So what are some of the uses for React Porta?

**when we need to render child components outside the normal DOM hierarchy without breaking the event propagation's default behavior through the React component tree hierarchy. This is useful when rendering components such as modals, tooltips and popup messages.**
