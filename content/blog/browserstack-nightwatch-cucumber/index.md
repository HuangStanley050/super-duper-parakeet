## The task

End to end testing was something pretty new to me and I chose to pick up this task so I can learn something new. The team already has the e2e testing set up and running on a local environment and what we wanted to do was incorporate the e2e with Browserstack to leverage running tests on real devices.

The set up is pretty much what is recommended with the official documentation by the new nightwatch-api [setup with nighwatch and cucumber](https://nightwatch-api.netlify.app/cucumber/). From my limited knowledge/understanding I gather that we use cucumber-js as the test runner with the nightwatch-api using selenium capability to run the test.
