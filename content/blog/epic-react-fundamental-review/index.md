So I was under the impression that I might not get much out of this section but boy was I wrong. After going through this section, I managed to pick up many useful things and thing that I genuinely didn't know about React. After using React for awhile I can appreciate learning the nitty gritty aspect of it which I am hoping to get myself close to getting better at it.
