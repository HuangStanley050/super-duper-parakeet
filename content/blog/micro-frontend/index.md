## Intro

You can't talk about micro frontend without knowing something about micro-services. The whole idea is to split the services into its own stand alone api's instead of utilizing the old monolithic architecture like before. With Micro services, you are able to have multiple teams working on different set of api's independently without relying too much on other teams.

What about front end app? Traditionally it's done as one giant code base but with the popularity of the micro services idea, the micro front end concept is born.
